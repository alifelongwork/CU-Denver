Sub-Repo for research performed at UCDenver during the PhD Program. The research subjects include the application of the Ising Model from Statistical Mechanics towards neural networks of the brain. Other included projects include a generic UI design using streamlit and python for interfacing with AI models and providing an explanation for the results of the model using various XAI techniques. Projects related to quantum computing may also be found in here which were geared more towards classroom research projects as part of the Quantum Computing Technology Certification program offerred at UC Denver.
