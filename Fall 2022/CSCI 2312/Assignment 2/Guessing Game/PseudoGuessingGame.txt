While the user wants to keep playing

initialize random number from 0 to 999

print enter a number between 0 and 999

initialize user guess

if the user guess is equal to the random number
  print good job first try
else
  do
    if guess greater than random number
      print user guess is too high
      store new number
      increase try count
      print new guess and try count
    else if guess less than random number
      print user guess is too low
      store new number
      increase try count
      print new guess and try count
    else 
      user is no longer wrong
  while user is wrong
